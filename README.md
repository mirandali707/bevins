# roger bevins iii -- lincoln in the bardo

"Bevins" had several sets of eyes   All darting to and fro    Several noses   All sniffing    His hands (he had multiple sets of hands, or else his hands were so quick they seemed to be many) struck this way and that, picking things up, bringing them to his face with a most inquisitive
Little bit scary
In telling his story he had grown so many extra eyes and noses and hands that his body all but vanished   Eyes like grapes on a vine Hands feeling the eyes   Noses smelling the hands
Slashes on every one of the wrists.
